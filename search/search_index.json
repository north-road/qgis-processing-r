The plugin allows execution of R scripts directly from QGIS on data loaded in QGIS. Important note regarding R packages As of November 2023 R package rgdal was retired and removed from CRAN, which means it is no longer easily installable. To reflect this the plugin moves from using this package to only supporting sf for vector data and raster for raster data. If you need to convert to vector format of sp package, which was previously done by loading data using rgdal , you need to load data using sf and then convert to sp . Example how to do that is in this script . The same applies for loading raster data using rgdal , these are now loaded using raster package. Options load_raster_using_rgdal , dontuserasterpackage and load_vector_using_rgdal are removed from plugin version 4.0.0 and will have no effects on scripts (effectively those lines will be skipped). Installation The plugin is available QGIS Python Plugins Repository here . It can also be installed directly from QGIS via the Plugins tool. Building from source for offline install can be done by downloading the source code and running command: make zip in the main directory. The produced zip file can then be installed in QGIS from Plugins tool in the Install from zip window. Contributors List of project contributors on GitHub. R R is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It has to be installed separately ( Download and Install R ), together with a few necessary libraries. The beauty of Processing implementation is that you can add your scripts, simple or complex ones, and they may then be used as any other module, piped into more complex workflows, etc. Test some of the preinstalled examples, if you have R already installed. Settings for the plugin Linux On Linux, the toolbox should find system installation of R on its own. Windows If R is installed in the expected path (e.g. \"C:\\PROGRAM FILES\\R\\\"), the plugin tries to detect the R installation automatically. Otherwise, it is necessary to set the setting \"R folder\" to the correct folder, as seen on the image. The correct folder is the one under which folders \"bin\", \"doc\", \"etc\" and others exist. Generally, it is a folder that has R's version in its name.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#processing-r-provider","text":"Processing provider for R scripts plugin for QGIS .

These are classic R scripts with several metadata lines (starting with ## ) that define the interaction between QGIS and R. Metadata amongst other things specify how UI of the tool will look like. The script loads necessary packages by itself. Combination of sp and rgdal or sf for vector data and sp and rgdal or raster for raster data. Any other packages need to be directly loaded using library() command in the script body. Metadata The R script's file name is used to define the script name and id in the R processing provider. You can override these default metadata with these lines. ##script_name=name script_name is the name of the script; under this name, it will be listed in processing toolbox. It is also used to define the script id in the R processing provider. ##script_title=display_name script_title is the title of the script; under this title, it will be listed in processing toolbox. It overrides the name if it is defined after. ##group_name=group group_name is the name of the group of the script, which allows sorting of scripts into groups in processing toolbox. Script behaviour Several metadata lines define the general behaviour of the script. ##output_plots_to_html (older version of this metadata keyword is ##showplots ) defines that there will be graphical output from the script that will be presented as an HTML page with images. ##pass_filenames (legacy alias ##passfilenames ) specifies that data are not passed directly. Instead only their file names are passed. ##dont_load_any_packages specifies that no packages, besides what is directly specified in script, should be loaded. This means that neither of sf , raster , sp or rgdal packages is loaded automatically. If spatial data (either raster or vector) should be passed to this script, the metadata ##pass_filenames should be used as well. ##user1/repo1,user2/repo2=github_install allows instalation of R packages from GitHub using remotes . Multiple repos can be specified and divided by coma, white spaces around are stripped. The formats for repository specification are listed on remotes website . Inputs Simple specification The inputs to R script are specified as: variable_name=variable_type [default_value/from_variable] . This metadata line also specifies how tool UI will look in QGIS, as inputs are one section of the tool UI. In this specification variable_name is the name of the variable used in R script, variable_type is a type of input variable from possible input types (vector, raster, table, number, string, boolean, Field). This metadata line is based on the QGIS parameter asScriptCode / fromScriptCode string definition. The default_value is applicable to number, string, boolean, range, color folder and file inputs. The from variable_ applies to Field and must point to variable_name of vector input. So the inputs can look like this: ##Layer=vector specifies that there will be variable Layer that will be a vector. ##X=Field Layer specifies that variable X will be field name taken from Layer . ##Raster_Layer=raster specifies that there will be variable Layer that will be a raster. ##X=Band Raster_Layer specifies that variable X will be raster band index taken from Raster_Layer . ##Size=number 10 specifies that there will be variable Size that will be numeric, and a default value for Size will be 10 . ##Extent=extent specifies that there will be variable Extent that will be numeric of length 4 ( xmin , xmax , ymin and ymax values). ##CRS=crs specifies that there will be variable CRS that will be EPSG:____ string. ##Range=range 0,1 specifies that the Range variable will be a two numeric values vector with names (min/max values). The parameter accepts default values, e.g. 0,1 . A range widget will be displayed for setting the values. ##Color=color withopacity #FF0000CC specifies that the Color variable will be a text string of the chosen color in hexadecimal format. This parameter will display a color selection widget. The parameter accepts default values, for example #FF0000 . The opacity value depends on the withopacity option. ##Date_Time=datetime specifies that the Date_Time variable will be a POSIXct vector of length 1 of the date and time choosing from the datetime widget . The parameter does not accept default values, instead, the current date and time will set by default. Enum The basic enum syntax is ##var_enum=enum a;b;c to select from values a , b or c . The value of var_enum in this case will be integer indicated position of the selected item in a list. So for example, if a is selected the value of var_enum will be 0 . The approach described above works well for a wide range of applications but for R it is often not ideal. That is a reason why a new type of enum is available in script syntax. The syntax is ##var_enum_string=enum literal a;b;c . The important part here is the keyword literal (or more precisely enum literal ) which specifies that the value from the select box to var_enum_string should be passed as a string. So if b is selected, then the value of var_enum_string will be \"b\" . Enum also accept multiples choices in both, literal or numeric setups, i.e. ##var_enum_string=enum literal multiple a;b;c or ##var_enum_string=enum multiple a;b;c . The variables in R will behave in the same way as non-multiple setup. Advanced specification The inputs to R script are specified as: QgsProcessingParameter|name|description|other_parameters_separated_by_pipe . The other parameter_ separated_ by_ pipe_ can contain the QgsProcessingParameter specific parameters. This metadata line is based on the QGIS definitions used in description file used by GRASS7, SAGA and others providers. So the inputs can look like this: ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Vector layer specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a vector. ##QgsProcessingParameterField|FIELDS|Attributes|None|INPUT|-1|False|False specifies that there will be variable FIELDS that will be a field index. ##QgsProcessingParameterRasterLayer|INPUT|Grid specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a raster. ##QgsProcessingParameterNumber|SIZE|Aggregation Size|QgsProcessingParameterNumber.Integer|10 specifies that there will be variable Size that will be numeric, and a default value for Size will be 10 . ##QgsProcessingParameterEnum|METHOD|Method|[0] Sum;[1] Min;[2] Max specifies that there will be variable METHOD that will be a value provided under [] . ##QgsProcessingParameterVectorDestination|OUTPUT|Result specifies that there will be variable OUTPUT that will be the destination file. Feature source ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|name|description|geometry type|default value|optional * name is mandatory * description is mandatory * geometry type is optional and the default value is -1 for any geometry, the available values are 0 for point, 1 for line, 2 for polygon, 5 for table * default value is optional and the default value is None * optional is optional and the default value is False ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Points|0 specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a vector point layer. ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Lines|1 specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a vector line layer. ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Polygons|2 specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a vector polygon layer. ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Table|5 specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be a vector layer to provide table. ##QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource|INPUT|Optional layer|-1|None|True specifies that there will be variable INPUT that will be an optional vector layer. Raster layer ##QgsProcessingParameterRasterLayer|name|description|default value|optional * name is mandatory * description is mandatory * default value is optional and the default value is None * optional is optional and the default value is False File or folder parameter ##QgsProcessingParameterFile|name|description|behavior|extension|default value|optional|file filter * name is mandatory * description is mandatory * behavior is optional and the default value is 0 for file, 1 is for folder input parameter * extension is optional and specifies a file extension associated with the parameter (e.g. html ). Use file filter for a more flexible approach which allows for multiple file extensions. if file filter is specified it takes precedence and extension is emptied. * default value is optional and the default value is None * optional is optional and the default value is False * file filter is optional and specifies the available file extensions associted sith the parameter (e.g. PNG Files (*.png);; JPG Files (*.jpg *.jpeg) ) ##QgsProcessingParameterFile|in_file|Input file specifies that there will be variable in_file that will be any file. ##QgsProcessingParameterFile|in_folder|Input folder|1 specifies that there will be variable in_folder that will be a folder. ##QgsProcessingParameterFile|in_gpkg|Input gpkg|0|gpkg specifies that there will be variable in_gpkg that will be gpkg file. ##QgsProcessingParameterFile|in_img|Input img|0|png|None|False|PNG Files (*.png);; JPG Files (*.jpg *.jpeg) specifies that there will be variable in_img that will be an image PNG or JPG. QGIS Expression A QGIS expression can be used as input for the script. The syntax is r_variable_name=expression followed by space and any valid QGIS expression. The expression is evaluated in QGIS before passing the result value script to R. This type of input is hidden from user of the script and can only be modified by editing the R script itself. The following code: ##qgis_expression=expression @qgis_version creates variable qgis_expression that will hold information about QGIS version on which the script was run (i.e. 3.22.0-Bia\u0142owie\u017ca ). ##example_geometry=expression make_circle( make_point(0, 0), 10) creates R variable with name example_geometry that holds polygon created by the expression. The variable type for R is determined from type of expression output in QGIS. So far these types are supported - string, integer, float, date, time, datetime, geometry and lists (arrays) of these types. Outputs The outputs of R script are specified as ##variable_name=output output_type . This line also specifies how tool UI will look in QGIS, as outputs are one section of the tool UI. In this specification variable_name specifies variable from the script that will be exported back to QGIS, output_type is one of the allowed types that can be returned from R script (layer, raster, folder, file, HTML, number, string, table). So the outputs can look like this: ##New_string=output string specifies that a variable New_string will be set in the script. ##New_number=output number specifies that a variable New_number will be set in the script. Layer outputs For layer outputs, the line definition can end with the noprompt keyword. In this case, the variable_name has to be defined in the script. Otherwise, the UI will display a widget to let the user defined the output destination. ##New_layer=output vector specifies that the variable New_layer will be imported to QGIS as a vector layer. ##New_raster=output raster specifies that variable New_raster will be imported to QGIS as a raster layer. ##New_table=output table specifies that the variable New_table will be imported to QGIS as a vector layer without geometry (CSV file). Folder and files outputs Like layer outputs, the folder and files outputs the line definition can end with the noprompt keyword. ##New_file=output file specifies that there will be variable New_file that will be a file path with .file extension ##New_csv=output file csv specifies that there will be variable New_csv that will be a file path with .csv extension ##New_folder=output folder specifies that there will be variable New_folder that will be a folder path Printing from R to tool log If any output of any line in R script should be outputted to tool log, it needs to be preceded by > .

This metadata line also specifies how tool UI will look in QGIS, as inputs are one section of the tool UI. In this specification variable_name is the name of the variable used in R script, variable_type is a type of input variable from possible input types (vector, raster, table, number, string, boolean, Field). This metadata line is based on the QGIS parameter asScriptCode / fromScriptCode string definition. The default_value is applicable to number, string, boolean, range, color folder and file inputs. The from variable_ applies to Field and must point to variable_name of vector input. So the inputs can look like this: ##Layer=vector specifies that there will be variable Layer that will be a vector. ##X=Field Layer specifies that variable X will be field name taken from Layer . ##Raster_Layer=raster specifies that there will be variable Layer that will be a raster. ##X=Band Raster_Layer specifies that variable X will be raster band index taken from Raster_Layer . ##Size=number 10 specifies that there will be variable Size that will be numeric, and a default value for Size will be 10 . ##Extent=extent specifies that there will be variable Extent that will be numeric of length 4 ( xmin , xmax , ymin and ymax values). ##CRS=crs specifies that there will be variable CRS that will be EPSG:____ string. ##Range=range 0,1 specifies that the Range variable will be a two numeric values vector with names (min/max values). The parameter accepts default values, e.g. 0,1 . A range widget will be displayed for setting the values. ##Color=color withopacity #FF0000CC specifies that the Color variable will be a text string of the chosen color in hexadecimal format. This parameter will display a color selection widget. The parameter accepts default values, for example #FF0000 . The opacity value depends on the withopacity option. ##Date_Time=datetime specifies that the Date_Time variable will be a POSIXct vector of length 1 of the date and time choosing from the datetime widget .

The value of var_enum in this case will be integer indicated position of the selected item in a list. So for example, if a is selected the value of var_enum will be 0 . The approach described above works well for a wide range of applications but for R it is often not ideal. That is a reason why a new type of enum is available in script syntax. The syntax is ##var_enum_string=enum literal a;b;c . The important part here is the keyword literal (or more precisely enum literal ) which specifies that the value from the select box to var_enum_string should be passed as a string. So if b is selected, then the value of var_enum_string will be \"b\" . Enum also accept multiples choices in both, literal or numeric setups, i.e. ##var_enum_string=enum literal multiple a;b;c or ##var_enum_string=enum multiple a;b;c .
