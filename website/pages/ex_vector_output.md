# Example with vector output

This scripts takes input vector data and randomly samples _Size_ points over it. The result is returned as a vector layer.

## Script

```
##Point pattern analysis=group
##Sample random points=name
##Layer=vector
##Size=number 10
##Output= output vector
Layer_sp = as_Spatial(Layer)
pts = spsample(Layer_sp,Size,type="random")
Output = SpatialPointsDataFrame(pts, as.data.frame(pts))
```

## Script lines description

1. **Point pattern analysis** is the group of the algorithm.
2. **Sample random points** is the name of the algorithm.
3. **Layer** is the input vector layer.
4. **Size** is the numerical parameter with a default value of 10.
5. **Output** is the vector layer that will be created by the algorithm.
6. Convert from sf format to older sp format, for which `spsample()` works
7. Call the spsample function of the sp library and pass it to all the input defined above.
8. Create the output vector with the SpatialPointsDataFrame function.

Thatâ€™s it! Just run the algorithm with a vector layer you have in the QGIS Legend, choose a number of the random point, and you will get them in the QGIS Map Canvas.
